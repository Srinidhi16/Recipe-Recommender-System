this is my favorite recipe i ve ever made,0,2,9,0,0,2,3,0,0
i cut the red velvet in half at,1,0,8,0,0,3,1,0,0
it s diameter drying out the cake in the oven then blending it into fine,1,1,15,0,0,1,3,0,0
crumbs with a food processor i added about a tablespoon more butter to the,1,1,14,0,0,6,1,1,0
crust and packed it into the bottom of a 9 inch pan instead of 10 i then cut,1,1,18,1,3,5,2,1,0
the other half in half so if i used the whole cake i would have had quarters,1,1,17,0,0,6,3,0,0
and then i cut those down the middle as if i was making a layer cake instead,1,1,17,0,0,3,3,0,0
of cubing it after i put my first layer of the cheesecake in the pan i,1,1,16,0,0,5,2,0,0
arranged the sliced cake so it covered the surface completely and then put the,1,1,14,0,0,2,3,1,0
remaining cheesecake over it the only problem i had was that it didn t really,1,1,15,0,0,4,4,0,0
set in the fridge but i was using light cream cheese so that may have been,1,1,16,0,0,4,5,0,0
the problem i would definitely make this again as it got eaten in two days,0,1,15,0,0,3,2,0,0
