this recipe is one of my favorites and gets requested all the time i use,1,2,15,0,0,4,4,0,0
another cup of blueberries and a bit more cornstarch so that i can reduce the,1,1,15,0,0,5,1,1,0

this recipe is incredible i make a lot of cheesecakes and this may now be one,1,2,16,0,0,4,3,0,0
of my all time favourites it s now my man s favourite it s not too dense,1,1,17,0,0,2,3,0,0
like many recipes can be i used fresh regular blueberries instead of wild,1,1,13,0,0,2,3,0,0
regular sour cream instead of light the only recommendation would be that the,1,1,13,0,0,3,1,0,0
initial blueberry filling did not yield enough to put aside the extra 1/2 cup,1,1,14,1,2,2,4,1,0
for the final sauce so i had to make more made about 50 more than recipe,1,1,16,1,2,2,3,0,0
called for also as another reader suggested i had to bake it for about 20,1,1,15,1,2,2,4,0,0
min longer than suggested prior to putting on sour cream topping make this,1,1,13,0,0,1,4,0,0
