would have been way too thin of a crust had i only done the one cup 2 will,1,1,18,1,1,3,5,1,0

lemon juice to batter but will add some lemon zest to add more flavor 3,1,1,15,1,1,4,2,0,0
placed parchment paper at the bottom so when it cools i placed it on a plate,1,1,16,0,0,4,3,0,0
inside a cake cover for easy transport 4 used chilled blueberry pie,1,1,12,1,1,5,2,0,0
filling for the topping after it cooled in the fridge and it was quick and,1,1,15,0,0,2,3,0,0
yummy,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
5 one hour baking made browning on the edges so would probably bake for,1,0,14,1,1,2,4,0,0
only 45 minutes next time as it is suppose to be jiggly when out of the oven,1,1,17,1,2,3,2,0,0
and the cooling process and chilling will settle and make it dense enjoy,0,1,13,0,0,4,3,0,0
